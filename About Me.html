    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div id="content"><p>My name is Isaiah Johnson. 
        I'm a freshman currently, and I'm majoring in English, specifically the Creative Writing track. 
        On top of that, I'm looking to add a Computer Science double major, which is part of why I'm taking this class. 
        I enjoy playing video games, which is where my interest in programming stems from.
         I previously took a Python class in high school, but I don't retain too much of the information I learned.
         I'm hoping to learn more about programming and see if it's right for me as a career in the future.</p></div>
