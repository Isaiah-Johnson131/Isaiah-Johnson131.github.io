    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p>Thanks for visiting. 
        This website is for my CSC 106 class. 
        It's being created to learn the basics of HTML programming.
        It will be updated with various coding projects that I create throughout the class, and also includes personal information. 
        Check the various tabs for this information</p>
